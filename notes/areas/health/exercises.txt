I am currently a beginner in the gym, and I am following the guidance of Jeet Selal and Deltabolic.  
If I ask any questions about exercises, priority should be given to their advice. If the information is not in this note, any web search should first refer to their content.

1. General things to keep in mind  
   - Form and tempo matter more than weight.  
   - Focus on both the concentric and eccentric portions of each lift — both are important for development.  
   - Breathing: exhale during the concentric phase, inhale during the eccentric phase.  
   - Mind-muscle connection is very important at the beginner phase.  
   - Tempo should be: 3…2…1 (lowering) then contract for 1, then 3…2…1 again (lowering) then 1… (pause), then 3…2…1, etc.  
   - Abs training is not equivalent to cardio.  
   - I am currently following a BRO-split.  
   - For muscle building, the most important things are: form, tempo, progressive overload.  
   - When lifting dumbbells (especially heavier ones), lift them from the ground with a deadlift, bring them up to your thighs, then perform the exercise (such as kickbacks).  
   - When dropping weights, never drop outward; tuck your elbows in and then let the weight drop downwards safely.

2. Warm-up exercises  
   1. General  
      i. Do it for **5-8 minutes** so that your joints and muscles are activated and ready for work.  

   2. Exercises for warm-up  
      For upper body:  
      1. Jumping Jacks (1 minute)  
      2. Wrist Movements – 2 sets × 10 reps each, clockwise and counter-clockwise  
      3. Shoulder Rotations – 2 sets × 10 reps each, clockwise and counter-clockwise  
      4. Shoulder Press with light dumbbells – 1 set × 5 reps (optional)  
      5. Neck Rotations – forward/backward, side-to-side, 5 reps each direction (optional; but must on chest day and back day)  
      6. Rotator Cuff (using cable or band) – internal + external rotations on both sides, 1 set each, 10 reps  

      For lower body:  
      1. Hamstring Stretch – 2 sets × 10 reps each leg  
      2. Hip Flexor Stretch – 1 set × 20 seconds each leg  
      3. Deep-squat hold (30 seconds hold)
3. Chest  

   1. General  
      a. There are three main chest muscle regions: upper chest, mid-chest (just above the nipples) and lower chest (below the nipple). For the upper chest, you should feel the muscle fibres just beneath the collarbone/clevic region during contraction when using incline movements.  
      b. The role of the chest muscles is to bring the arms inward across the chest and push them outward—i.e., moving from wide to close (adduction) and back.  
      c. For pressing exercises here: keep chest expanded (outwards), retract the shoulders, maintain a slight arch in the back. A simple mental hack: imagine a ring around your mid-back and push your chest forward through that ring.  
      d. Shoulders must stay retracted during both concentric and eccentric phases; do *not* allow the shoulders to roll forward, otherwise shoulder activation takes over the chest.

   2. Flat Dumbbell Chest Press  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Lift the dumbbells from the ground using a deadlift motion (as mentioned earlier): bring them to your thighs, then roll back onto the bench, bring dumbbells near chest, get ready to lift.  
         ii. When kicking back the dumbbells onto the bench, keep them close to your body when arriving—elbows should be settled and stable to avoid shoulder issues.  
         iii. Shoulder blades retracted, slight arch in back, chest up.  
         iv. Elbows should be at about a 45° angle relative to the torso (not 0° and not 90°); if you go too wide (180°) you put load on the shoulders instead—very important.  
         v. At top position the dumbbells should be above the chest, *not* above the shoulders; when lowering bring them down to around the nipple area.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. While lowering: bring the dumbbells near the chest (not touching necessarily, but close), avoid going too deep such that the shoulders take over. With experience you’ll find the sweet spot.  
         ii. Press up without locking elbows. Dumbbells should *not* collide—focus on bringing the elbows closer together, not the dumbbells hitting.  
         iii. Lower in a slight curve or arc (not strictly vertical) for better activation of chest fibres.  
         iv. Use tempo: lowering 3…2…1, then push up in ~1 second, hold for ~0.5 second, then repeat.  
         v. Since this targets mid-chest, when lowering aim to bring the dumbbells to around nipple level.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 4 working sets + 2 warm-up sets if required.  
         ii. 12 reps (ideally to failure) on working sets.  
         iii. Rest ~1 minute between sets.

   3. Inclined Dumbbell Chest Press  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Same setup & posture as flat dumbbell press, but done on an incline bench. Use the incline machine bench or adjustable bench; roughly 30° angle is suitable.  
         ii. The point is to target the upper chest fibres. When lowering the dumbbells, aim near the upper chest/clevic region—not too low.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Lower until the dumbbells approach the upper chest region (slightly above nipple level) so the clavicular fibres are engaged.  
         ii. Press up without locking elbows, maintain control and tempo.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 working sets + 1 warm-up if required.  
         ii. 12 reps to failure.

   4. Pec-Dec / Fly Machine  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. In the machine, set the arms in the starting “open” position. Pull one side, then the other; initiate with a controlled negative (eccentric) phase and then start the concentric.  
         ii. Adjust the seat/arm position so your arms (at start) are in line with your chest: arms neither too high nor too low. They should align roughly with the nipple line or just slightly above.  
         iii. Chest up, shoulders retracted, legs spread for stability (~45° stance). Slight arch in the back; imagine the mid-back pushing forward.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. In the concentric phase bring elbows closer together (rather than just the handles) until you feel a strong chest contraction.  
         ii. In the stretch/return (eccentric) avoid straight-locking the elbows; too large stretch and you shift load to biceps/shoulders. Don’t pull the handles too far back; the handles should stay roughly in line with your chest.  
         iii. Tempo: lowering phase (eccentric) 3…2…1, then press (concentric) in ~1 sec.  
         iv. Keep shoulders retracted throughout; don’t allow them to roll or pronate. In stretch phase maintain a slight bend in elbows (~120° between upper arms) so the chest has maximum activation rather than arms/shoulders.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 working sets + 1 warm-up if needed.  
         ii. 12 reps to concentric failure.  
      d. Mistakes & Things to Keep in Mind  
         i. Watch the elbow angle in the eccentric stretch: not too wide, not too close (aim ~120°).  
         ii. Ensure the machine is adjusted so the chest (pec) and not the arms/shoulders is doing the work—if you feel arms doing more, reposition seat/arms.

   5. Incline Dumbbell Fly  
      i. Setup & Posture  
         - Use the same incline angle (~30°) as the incline press.  
         - Chest up, shoulders retracted.  
         - Dumbbells start above the upper chest (slightly above nipple level).  
         - Elbows are slightly bent (~45° outward) and the arms begin **below** shoulder level at start.  
      ii. Range of Motion  
         - Very similar to pec-dec fly: focus on bringing elbows together and chest-activation rather than just handles. Use the same control, tempo, and mind-muscle connection.  
         - Lower to a comfortable stretch, then bring up focusing on chest contraction.  
      iii. Sets & Reps  
         - Same as pec-dec fly: 3 working sets + warm-up if needed. 12 reps to failure.

   6. Decline Dumbbell Fly  
      - Setup, posture, tempo, sets & reps are mostly identical to the incline dumbbell fly, except:  
         * Use a decline bench (one notch below flat, not too steep).  
         * Dumbbells in the top position should be above the lower chest region (below nipple) so the lower chest fibres are engaged.  
         * All other instructions (tempo, mind-muscle, shoulder retraction) remain consistent with the fly exercises above.  

4. Back  

   1. General  
      - The back is a large muscle group. Imagine a “V” shape at the sides: the lats (latissimus dorsi) span from the mid-/lower-back up behind the arms. The upper back includes traps, rear delts and related muscles; the mid-back and lower-back follow below.  
      - The lats’ primary actions: extension of the arms downward/backward, adduction (bringing the arms toward the body), and inward rotation of the upper arm.  
      - To emphasise lat development, focus on pulling with your elbows down and back (rather than just pulling with your arms). Keep chest up, shoulders retracted, and mind-muscle connect with the lats rather than arms.

   2. Lat Pulldown  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Sit at the lat-pulldown machine; the bar should be positioned above your forehead/upper chest when you reach up.  
         ii. Grip the bar at roughly shoulder-width, overhand. Consider a “false” (thumbless) grip for better lat activation.  
         iii. Retract shoulder blades (pinch back) before initiating the pull.  
         iv. Elbows should travel downward without flaring out excessively.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Pull the bar down by driving elbows straight down (vertical path) rather than slanting outward; this better targets the lats. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
         ii. Lean your torso slightly back (~10-15°) as you bring the bar to your upper chest/just below the collarbone.  
         iii. At the bottom, hold the position ~0.5 seconds, feeling the lat contraction.  
         iv. On the return, allow your torso to move toward vertical (0° lean), keep shoulders retracted and slowly control the bar up to full arm extension.  
         v. Close your eyes briefly if helpful to enhance mind-muscle connection and feel your lats working.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 working sets (plus 1 warm-up set if needed)  
         ii. 12-15 reps per set  
      d. Things to Keep in Mind / Common Mistakes  
         i. Avoid pulling too far behind your head — this shifts tension away from the lats and can stress the shoulders. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
         ii. Do not rely primarily on your arms/forearms to pull — focus on driving elbows down and engaging the lats. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
         iii. Keep the torso stable — too much leaning back turns the movement into a row, reducing lat focus. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

   3. Seal Row  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Adjust bench to ~30° incline (two notches up from flat).  
         ii. Hold dumbbells in both hands with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Perform a row: drive elbows back in a curved path toward your lower ribs/hips, squeezing upper back/rear-delt/lats region.  
         ii. Tempo: lower(controlled) for 3…2…1 seconds, row up in ~1 second, pause briefly at top.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. 12 reps per set  

   4. Close-Grip Seated Rows (Horizontal Pull)  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Use the seated row machine with a V-grip handle. Raise the thigh-pad so it doesn’t interfere and your torso remains stable.  
         ii. Retract shoulder blades, keep chest up, elbows beside torso and handle pulled near your navel-area.  
         iii. Feet firmly on foot-platform, stable posture.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Pull toward your lower abdomen/navel: focus on lats and mid-back during concentric phase.  
         ii. Eccentric: slowly return the weight, shoulders may pronate slightly but keep lower back neutral.  
         iii. Tempo: 3…2…1 seconds on return, pull up in ~1 second, hold briefly.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. ~12 reps per set  

   5. Wide-Grip Seated Rows  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Same machine as above. Instead of V-grip, use the lat-pulldown bar or a wide horizontal bar.  
         ii. Elbows may flare out slightly (~45°) during the pull, and you will bring the bar/handle toward upper-abdomen (above the navel).  
      b. Range of Motion & other rules  
         i. Same fundamental cues as close-grip row: chest up, shoulder blades retracted, strong lat engagement.  
         ii. Slight elbow flare allows more upper-back and outer-lat emphasis.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. ~12 reps  

   6. Straight-Arm Lat Pulldown  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Use a cable machine with a high attachment point (e.g., bar, rope) above head height.  
         ii. Stand in front of the machine, feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, lower-back slightly arched, shoulders retracted and depressed. Use a thumbless grip if it helps focus.  
         iii. Arms remain nearly straight throughout the movement (minor bend allowed).  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Start with arms raised or in line with shoulders; keep them extended (or slightly bent) and pull downward in an arc toward your thighs/upper-hips while focusing on lats.  
         ii. At bottom, feel full contraction of the lats, then slowly return to start.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. ~12 reps per set  
      d. Things to Keep in Mind  
         i. Because this exercise uses extended arms, triceps and shoulders may assist — ensure you feel the lats working by drive-down motion and mind-muscle connection.

10. Legs  
   1. General  
      - Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves  
   2. Leg Press  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Get onto the machine and if there is a lever/back pad, set it to the lowest position.  
         ii. Feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward.  
         iii. The main pressure should come from the heels, not the toes.  
         iv. Maintain chest up and shoulders retracted throughout.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Lower until the quads touch the stomach.  
         ii. When legs are down, don’t keep them too close; keep them slightly outward (around 45°) so the outer quads engage rather than the area near the navel.  
         iii. When pushing up, avoid locking the elbows; keep a slight bend.  
         iv. Use the tempo: 3…2…1 (down) then press up in 1.  
      c. Reps & Sets  
         i. 4 working sets  
         ii. 12-15 reps to failure  
         iii. 1-2 warm-up sets if required  
      d. Mistakes & Things to Keep in Mind  
         i. Don’t push primarily with the toes.  
         ii. While lowering, ensure your hips don’t roll or shift sideways.  
   3. Leg Curl  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Sit on the leg-curl machine.  
         ii. The bench end should be just behind your knees.  
         iii. Adjust the roller so that leg movement is locked in and the hamstrings are isolated.  
         iv. Position the lower roller so that when legs are nearly flat it’s near the bottom.  
         v. Hold the handles, keep back and hips firmly against the seat.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. In the concentric phase legs fold; at the peak position the knee angle should be around 30°. In the eccentric phase return to nearly flat legs.  
         ii. Use the tempo: 3…2…1 down (eccentric) then 1 up (concentric).  
         iii. It’s like the “biceps of the legs”.  
      c. Reps & Sets  
         i. 3 sets (plus 1 warm-up set if needed)  
         ii. 12-15 reps  
   4. Standing Stiff-Leg Deadlift  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Use a bench or support to hold onto with one hand.  
         ii. Hold a dumbbell in one hand; the corresponding leg will be the working leg.  
         iii. Keep your back straight and core engaged.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Keep the working leg mostly straight (slight bend at the knee only), then lower the dumbbell while raising the opposite leg backward.  
         ii. Repeat for each leg in turn.  
      c. Reps & Sets  
         i. 3 sets per leg  
         ii. 12-15 reps per leg  
      d. Mistakes & Things to Keep in Mind  
         i. Because this is a deadlift variation, the lower back may give out first — ensure hamstrings and glutes are correctly engaged and form is strict.  
   5. Standing Calf Raise (Upper Calf)  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Use the Smith machine barbell.  
         ii. Rest the bar on the traps/upper back.  
         iii. When unhooking the bar, roll it forward (not backward) so that your center of gravity stays over your shoulders — rolling backward may cause imbalance.  
         iv. Use a step-block so that the thicker ball-region of the fore-feet rests on the block and around 30-40% of the foot is off the step — not 50% or more, otherwise you will lose stretch.  
         v. Keep knees slightly soft (not locked).  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Raise up, feel full contraction.  
         ii. Lower fully to stretch the calves.  
         iii. Repeat with control.  
      c. Reps & Sets  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. 15 reps  
   6. Seated Calf Raise (Lower Calf)  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Sit on the machine, place the padded rod across your laps (just above knees) and rest the feet on the block so the calves hang off.  
         ii. This specifically targets the lower part of the calves.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. Similar to the standing version: raise up, then lower down fully. In advanced form you can use a step below the feet for extra stretch.  
      c. Reps & Sets  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. 15 reps  
   7. Leg Extension  
      a. Setup & Posture  
         i. Sit on the machine. Place the roller pad just above your ankles. Ensure your thighs are flush against the seat so quads isolate.  
         ii. Knees should be aligned at the edge of the seat. Feet shoulder-width, toes pointing up.  
      b. Range of Motion  
         i. In full extension the knee angle will approach 180° (or as allowed by the machine); fold until around 30°.  
         ii. Use the tempo: 3…2…1 (down) then 1 up.  
      c. Sets & Reps  
         i. 3 sets  
         ii. 12-15 reps
